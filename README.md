The long term goal is to make a dashboard with easy browsing for said links, and possibly look into what links are the most frequently shared.

##Setup

2: copy config.json.sample -> config.json
3: Setup dev.twitter.com account, and authorize it for read/write
4: input secret codes and api keys into config.json
5: node start index.js
